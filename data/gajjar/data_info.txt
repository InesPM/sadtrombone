Hey Fereshteh, Martin,

In the Google Drive:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lLwei60tkV3H1Q_cMH1oHQRBSBVegLUW

there’s a new sub-folder called BL_Archives_ASCII.  I put ASCII data for two of the (bright) Gajjar et al. bursts there.  Here too the band is inverted.  Also, you’ll probably have to zap a few of the channels if you want to plot a nice dynamic spectrum.

Other info:

Centre of band: 6407.7148 MHz
Bandwidth: -3562.5 MHz (inverted band)
Channel width: -1.46484375 MHz (inverted band)
Number of channels: 2432
Time resolution: 4.0958926622802e-05 seconds

Do you really need _all_ the Gajjar et al. bursts?  Maybe I can just download a couple more of the brightest ones?  They’re a bit of a pain to process before the raw time/frequency resolution is quite high.

Please check out the files in the Google Drive, let me know if it makes sense, if you have any problems, or any questions.  As before, the data are de-Faradayed and de-dispersed.  Cautionary note there: one needs to assume an optical RM and DM for that, and that depends a bit on what metric one chooses.

Cheers,

Jason
