* Andersen 2019: "repeater bursts are generally wider than those of CHIME/FRB bursts
that have not repeated, suggesting different emission mechanisms."
	* should get some non-repeaters as well as repeaters

* downloaded data for FRB180110 from ASKAP site
    * format in SIGPROC filterbank format (http://sigproc.sourceforge.net/sigproc.pdf), http://sigproc.sourceforge.net/
    * PRESTO (https://www.cv.nrao.edu/~sransom/presto/) is related
* downloaded FRB180814 (CHIME)
    * who is making these shitty archaic data repositories? Their jnlp download manager downloads empty files and I'll have to write a wget script if I don't want to click a million links

* CHIME cfod package seems to work fine... but doesn't look like a burst
