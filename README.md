# Sad Trombone

This repository contains code for 

* computing autocorrelations of dynamic spectra of fast radio bursts
* fitting rotatable 2d gaussians to said autocorrelations
* producing a fit to the trend between the sub-burst drift rate and the duration
* supplemental and diagnostic figures. For figures of every burst and the corresponding fit used in the paper see [`figures/with_drift/`](https://github.com/mef51/sadtrombone/tree/master/figures/with_drift)

and is terribly disorganized, with ugly hacks and duplicated code all over. Please open an issue for any specific help or questions you might have.

..Or come back in September 2020, when it will be a lot better organized
