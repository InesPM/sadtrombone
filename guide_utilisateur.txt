How to use the different codes :

WARNING : All the time and frequency data are not in the good unit. The aythor gave the fmin and the step between the different 
values of time and frequency so that one can adjust the good values for the FWHM in particular.

1) Use "ecriture_input_Micchili2.py" in order to compare the plot of summation on frequency with the article (often shown) and to get
the time range where the majority of the signal (burst) is.

1bis) Use "fit2.py" with the outputfile of the precedent step, to plot.

2) Use "ecriture_matrice_intensite.py" in order to compare the matrix intensity in a frequency vs time base. You will then have the
frequency range on wich the burst is focused.

If it doesn't work well, it could be because of 3 things mainly :

--> Bad choice of time interval like tmax too high, or the signal is not on the range you proposed.

--> You need to adjust vmin and vmax to see the contrast sometimes

--> Check the file you gave at the beginning and compare to the burst number you wanted to use

3) Use "ecriture_input_Micchili.py" in order to produce the summation on time (in the same output file you will have the mean and
variance for each frequency which you can plot, with or without cutting the noise of the data)

4) Use "fit.py" in order to plot the resulting fit with a function of your choice (gaussian(s) in this case).

5) When you have all the data, use the table of data "donnees_freq_intensites" that you will have complete to produce a 
"courbe_FWHM.txt" with all the data requested. Then use "tracer.py" with only little things to modify if you modified the number of
points on the graph.

NB : In the case of the data by Gajjar, a modification has been done to the "fit.py", thus becoming "fit_Gajjar.py", in order
to adapt to the form of the data. See the code for details
