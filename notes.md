* ecriture_matric_intensite.py shows the burst in frequency vs time grid. It is hella slow tho.
	* there is some processing and noise removal in here that I will just take for granted for now
* there are 16 burst with I,Q,U, and V
* just use scipy 2d autocorrelate

* scipy correlate2d is slow as shit oh my god like it won't even finish
* scipy fftconvolve is supposed to be the same thing but you transpose the second matrix?
	* its hella fast, i just dont understand the result
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51485146/efficient-2d-cross-correlation-in-python
* i put a window around the burst to make the data smaller and i get something reasonable with signal.correlate2d

====
* the form of the fitting function is e^(-y^2 - x^2) where x and y are the result of multiplying x' and y' by the rotation matrix (this allows the 2d gaussian to rotate)

april 11
====
* fitting stuff is working, now making script to process all the michilli bursts.
* found the edge of the burst (see bursts.csv) that makes a square window of data for autocorrelation
	* some bursts (like bursts 11, 10, 9, 5, and 4) are really hard to see. Using a logscale for the colors kinda helps (`plt.imshow(..., norm=mcolors.LogNorm(vmin=0, vmax=5000))`)

april 14
=====
* there is degeneracy in the fit: the solver can make sigma_x really big and then rotate it like crazy or it can make sigma_y big and rotate it a little

apr 15 meeting:
===
* do gajjar bursts, fix angle slope
* maybe use log scale for corr . fix colorbar
* fix scales, use physical units
* grab centre freq. from victor figure
* get error on theta

apr 18
=====
* switching to log scale for corr helps a lot. needed to flag bad values as black (there are negative values for some reason)
* angle is clockwise from the negative y-axis. Weird. https://www.desmos.com/calculator/xa91ccx6gp
	* sign error in twoD_gaussian. fixed. angle is counter-clockwise from positive x axis as intended
* pcov gives variances of the parameters, root of that gives standard dev (error)

apr 19
===
* if sigma_y > sigma_x: theta = theta - pi/2
* michilli 2018 fig.1: time and freq. resolutions are 20.48us and 6.24 MHz
* email says 10.24us and 1.5625 MHz
* freq channel 0 = 4100.78125 MHz
* fixed the axes

apr 20
===
* with the right angle slope is just tan(theta).
	* to get MHz/ms units multiply slope by 1.5625MHz/0.01024ms

apr 21
===
* plots with drift speed and error done. need to get the central frequency
* donnees_freq_intensite.pdf has central frequencies for burst 1, 3, 6, 14, and 16
	* i think these were generated with either fit.py or fit2.py
	* not sure how valid a single gaussian fit is for these bursts, which look like multiple gaussian peaks?
* for the central frequencies of the 5 bursts victor found, the lower frequency bursts have more drift! this is what Martin predicted.


apr 22
===
* meeting:
	* put log scale on burst
	* do mhz/ms like in chime paper

apr 23
===
* TODO:
	* do gajjar (6-8 GHz) bursts
	* fix the fit for burst #10
	* make bursts more visible (log scale or truncate the scale)
	* copy chime paper and list drifts in mhz/ms
	* correct for pulse width by approximating tau_0 = b/cos(theta-pi/2), make that figure
	* find central frequency of all bursts with gaussian fit. See bottom right panel of Chime figure: Fit gaussian to time integrated spectrum
	* JPL has 2 GHz observations, decide if we can include those

apr 25
====
* wip in gajjar. Fit looks good. I had to clip the spectrum because there were many negative values, possibly from the way I removed the error.
	* (may have removed the background two different ways: with victor's loop and then my thing. just pick one (mine since it removes noise as a function of freq.))

apr 26
====
* if i clip before autocorrelation i lose the gaussian - why?
* some confusion between np.indices and np.meshgrid... switching to np.indices for now. meshgrid doesn't make sense to me atm and it keeps fucking up my fit
* more problems with 11D..
	* work on approximating tau_0 with sigma so that we can make an actually interesting plot. should be quick and higher payoff
* https://www.desmos.com/calculator/i36rd5eyfu

apr 27
===
* ended up just converting the angle the solver spit out but I have drifts for 11A and 11D now

apr 28
===
* burst 10: solver was spitting out negative sigma_x and sigma_y (which is not a big deal) but was leading to the wrong theta. putting abs() around sigma_x and sigma_y fixed the angle
	* this burst still has two bursts so still need to window it. but its a minor correction.
* annotating points: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15910019/annotate-data-points-while-plotting-from-pandas-dataframe/15911372#15911372
* trends are not promising. michili bursts are everywhere

may 3
===
* after discussing with martin we realized we had measured pulse duration, and not arrival time as a function of frequency.
* started working on ArrivalTimes.ipynb, which fits gaussians row by row and grabs arrival and end times for each frequency.
    * Final result of this is to have the dynamic spectrum of each burst marked with start and end times for each frequency channel.

may 6
====
* I finished the arrival time stuff but it's not useful at the moment.
* martin re did parts of his analysis:
    * There are two processes: a steep drift that is within the burst, and a much larger one that is from burst to burst (when there are multiple bursts in quick succession)
* TODO:
    * separate out the subbursts in 11A
    * fix calculation of sigma_t

may 7
===
* found autocorrelation of subbursts of 11A, stored as .npy files
* found drifts. beware shearing when your cells aren't square. the major axis can look like the minor axis and vice versa

may 8
===
* i wonder if i should just do a gaussian fit to the time profile like in Josephy 2019 to get the pulse duration instead of using sigma_t. Its numbers don't really line up with a measurement by eye
* i was fitting to some of the bursts i excluded so the fit is improved ANND adding the gajjar subbursts fits so well to the trend

* chris's corr2d is ridiculously fast. Also, pythonic file read is much 6x faster (30s to 5s) than the dogshit that is np.loadtxt()
